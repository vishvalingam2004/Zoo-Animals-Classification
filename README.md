# ZOO-ANIMALS ML CLASSIFICATION MODEL.
More than 101 zoo animals to apply classification ML models.
# OVERVIEW
In this repo a model based on ml Classification is done to analyse and predict the categories of taken animals list from a zoo data source.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Zoo animals datasets consists of 101 animals in a zoo and 16 variables with several features that describes (the attributes), besides the class to which each animal belongs (the target).

43 animals from several classes except Mammals and Birds.
70 animals from species maintained by SÃ£o Paulo Zoo, being primarily animals of the Brazilian fauna in danger of extinction.

       'aquatic', 'predator', 'toothed', 'backbone', 'breathes', 'venomous',
       'fins', 'legs', 'tail', 'domestic', 'catsize'
